      <p class="main">
        Born and raised in Alamogordo, NM but now living in Arizona. I am a
        digital designer by day, artist/musician by night. I currently love
        creating artwork digitally in Procreate, but I have also started
        dabbling in block printing and linocuts. I love cycling and being
        outdoors and music is the way to my heart. </br></br>I've thoroughly enjoyed diving more into the world of coding and am always looking for a new challange. My next challenge is to learn React and all that I can do with it in my current role.

            This artwork is a piece I did following a #DTIYS on Instagram. A
            #DTIYS (or Draw this in Your Style) is when an artist will share a
            piece of artwork in their style, and your goal is to recreate it in
            your own style. This particular piece was a #DTIYS from an artist
            named @mumuchu. She is an incredible digital artist named Bekah
            Boehm based in Seattle. Check out her work, she has a fun, colorful
            style that inspired me to try something new.

          <p class="mb-5">
            I just love birds. I was inspired to create a raven drawing in Procreate by Greek mythology. Ravens in Greek mythology are associated with Apollo, the god of prophecy, and in many cultures, ravens and crows are considered sacred. In Norse Mythology, Odin is often depicted as having two ravens resting on his shoulders. They are also tied to shape shifters and thought to be spell casters. They often symbolize wisdom, affection, healing powers, longevity, death and fertility. They'd been considered bad omens as well as spirit guides, depending on the culture/country. What does a raven mean to you?

          <p class="mb-5">
            This particular piece was a prompt from another Procreate artist I really admire, Lisa Bardot. @bardotbrush. I found a reference photo on Pinterest and tried to focus solely on the blueberries, with the background intentionally more out of focus. Blueberries always remind me of my grandma. She would let me help her pick blueberries from the bush outside her house in Louisiana when my brother and I would visit for the summer.
