        Born and raised in Alamogordo, NM but now living in Arizona. I am a
        digital designer by day, artist/musician by night. I currently love
        creating artwork digitally in Procreate, but I have also started
        dabbling in block printing and linocuts. I love cycling and being
        outdoors and music is the way to my heart. </br></br>I've thoroughly enjoyed diving more into the world of coding and am always looking for a new challange. My next challenge is to learn React and all that I can do with it in my current role.

            This artwork is a piece I did following a #DTIYS on Instagram. A
            #DTIYS (or Draw this in Your Style) is when an artist will share a
            piece of artwork in their style, and your goal is to recreate it in
            your own style. This particular piece was a #DTIYS from an artist
            named @mumuchu. She is an incredible digital artist named Bekah
            Boehm based in Seattle. Check out her work, she has a fun, colorful
            style that inspired me to try something new.
