    <p class="text-center m-5 main">Born and raised in Alamogordo, NM, which is where I dreamed up a lot of what my life could be like outside of my small hometown nestled at the base of some of the most majestic mountains I've ever seen. I knew I was destined for something greater and I knew my art would be the thing that took me there. Over the years, I've struggled in finding my niche, and I'm still soul searching, hoping to find my own style. However, I will say this - Art is the thing in this world that just makes sense to me, and I know I just have to keep creating, even if it means I try something new every week. I currently love designing digitally in Procreate, but I have also started dabbling in block printing and linocuts. <br/><br/>More to come on that!</p>

            <p>This artwork is a piece I did following a #DTIYS on Instagram. A #DTIYS (or Draw this in Your Style) is when an artist will share a piece of artwork in their style, and your goal is to recreate it in your own style. This particular piece was a #DTIYS from an artist named @mumuchu. She is an incredible digital artist named Bekah Boehm based in Seattle. Check out her work, she has a fun, colorful style that inspired me to try something new.</p>
